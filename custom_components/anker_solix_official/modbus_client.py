# pymodbus reports a plain "device is offline" as WARNING/ERROR on every single
# retry, with no throttling. For a local_polling integration that reconnects
# forever, an unreachable device is an expected state, not an anomaly -- and we
# already report it ourselves through _handle_connection_error(), which is
# throttled (ERROR once per episode, then WARNING at most every 30s) and names
# the register range that failed. Left alone, one offline device emits ~48
# duplicate pymodbus WARNINGs per 15 minutes and buries the genuine faults.
#
# Demoting to DEBUG (never dropping) keeps the full retry trace available to
# anyone who sets pymodbus to DEBUG, while a normal log shows only our own
# throttled summary. Matched by prefix against the exact emitting call sites in
# pymodbus 3.11.1:
#   - transport/transport.py:250  Log.warning("Failed to connect {}", exc)
#       raised only for TimeoutError/OSError, and returns False rather than
#       raising, so our _ensure_connected_locked() always sees and reports it.
#   - transaction/transaction.py:151,199  "No response received after N retries"
#       surfaces to us as ModbusIOException and is re-logged with the register
#       range by _handle_connection_error().
#   - logging.py:152  "Repeating...."  pymodbus's own dedup placeholder,
#       carries no information at all.
#
# Deliberately NOT demoted: "ERROR: request ask for transaction_id=.. but got
# id=.." (framer/base.py:84) and the device-id variant. Those signal protocol
# desync rather than an offline device, and _should_disconnect_for() relies on
